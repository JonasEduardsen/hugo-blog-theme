abstract: This study examines the impact of business group (BG) affiliation on
  international sales intensity and diversi- fication in small and medium-sized
  enterprises (SMEs) by using a multi-country sample of over 13,000 SMEs from 34
  European countries. Drawing on the revised Uppsala internationalization model
  and network theory, this paper suggests that the effects of BG affiliation on
  international sales intensity and diversification depend on the geographical
  dispersion of the BG network ties, the size and the age of the firm, and the
  institutional support in the home country. Thus, we find that interfirm
  networks in the form of BGs are a double-edged sword that can have both
  favorable and unfavorable consequences for international sales, depending on
  the geographical dispersion of the BG’s ties. In addition, the results reveal
  that BG affiliation is more beneficial for smaller SMEs and SMEs in countries
  with lower institutional support that are more dependent on the network
  resources embedded within BG networks.
